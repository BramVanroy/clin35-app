              "description": "Natural language syntax and semantics interacts with prosodic structure. The sentence “All politicians aren’t corrupt,” for example, is scopally ambiguous between “all > not” and “not > all” interpretations, which intonation may disambiguate. Acquaintance with such facts is of general interest, presenting an exciting opportunity to raise architectural questions about natural language and to expose course participants to a diverse set of formal methods (e.g., constraint-based grammars, model theoretic semantics). We begin the course with elements of intonational phonology: The realization of suprasegmental features—i.e., pitch, loudness and duration—is structured and governed by abstract mental categories. We then turn to modeling how these prosodic structures interface with syntactic structure, as well as semantic and pragmatic interpretation. The empirical basis for these models involve both classical observations on the role of intonation in regulating discourse coherence, and ongoing debates on the effect of intonation on presupposition triggering and projection.",

              "description": "This advanced course in Language and Logic will explore interactions between the theory of the conditional and the theory of rational decision. Stalnaker (1971) and many following have argued that there is a close connection between conditionals and rational decision: at a first pass, you should do the act that, in expectation, WOULD bring about the best consequences IF you were to do it. This intuitive picture both constrains, and is constrained by, the theory of the conditional (in particular, its logic and semantics, and corresponding probabilities). The course will explore the interacting perspectives of decision theory (Fusco’s specialty) and conditional semantics (Mandelkern’s specialty).",

              "description": "Whether we like it or not, “bad words” are ubiquitous in natural language. While using such words has sometimes no significant effects, in many cases their use can produce real harm, by denigrating, silencing, and marginalizing the people they target. Slurs are one such type of “bad words”. Most researchers agree that the main function of slurs is that of derogating or dehumanizing, of signalling that their targets are unworthy of equal standing or full respect as persons. Figuring out how slurs achieve their main function is an important topic in contemporary philosophy of language and linguistics. In this introductory course, my aim is to present the main characteristics of slurs and their uses (not limited to derogation), explore the main views on their semantics and pragmatics, and show how they are connected to larger social phenomena like power structures and communal identities.",
